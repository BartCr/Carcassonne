## Carcassonne

This is a digital version of the board game Carcassonne.

When I started to learn Java, my first larger project was to write a computer game based on the board game Carcassonne by Klaus-JÃ¼rgen Wrede. That attempt was more or less successful.

Now, a few years later, I thought I could try it again to do it properly.
