## Carcassonne

This is a slightly adapted, digital version of the board game Carcassonne.

Carcassonne is a tile-based board game in a medieval setting created by Klaus-JÃ¼rgen Wrede.
This project implements Carcassonne as an open-source platform-independent computer game which supports up to five players at the same time with shared-screen multiplayer mode. It stays true to the original look and gameplay while making minor changes. It currently contains the complete main game, some features from extensions, as well as some completely new features.

It is my personal project I work on whenever I have time available.
It all began after I first started to learn Java. It was my first larger, more complex project, and I tried to write a computer game based on the board game Carcassonne. That attempt was more or less successful!

Three years later, in 2016, I thought I could try it again, from scratch, to do it properly.
Since then, this computer game has been an ongoing project...
