## Carcassonne

This is a slightly adapted, digital version of the board game Carcassonne.

After I started to learn Java, my first larger project was to write a computer game based on the board game Carcassonne by Klaus-JÃ¼rgen Wrede. That attempt was more or less successful.

Three years later, in 2016, I thought I could try it again to do it properly.
Since then, this has been an ongoing project for me to work on whenever I have time available.
